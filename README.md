# Schema Design and Relationships
## Category Schema
The Category schema defines the structure for product categories. Each category contains:

 - name: A unique and required string field to identify the category.
 - description: An optional field to describe the category.
 - timestamps: Automatically includes createdAt and updatedAt fields.


## Product Schema
The Product schema defines the structure for products. Each product contains:

 - name: A unique and required string field to identify the product.
 - price: A required number field with a minimum value of 0.
 - stock: A required field that defaults to 0, representing the available quantity.
 - categoryId: A required field referencing the Category model, establishing a relationship between products and categories.
 - timestamps: Automatically includes createdAt and updatedAt fields.

## Relationship
 - One-to-Many Relationship:
A single category can be associated with multiple products.
This relationship is maintained by storing the categoryId reference in the Product schema.

## Diagram Representation
 - Category (1) ---> (âˆž) Product
